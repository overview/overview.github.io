# Tag Tricks

Here is a collection of tagging tricks that have been helpful to our users.

Tracking documents to review
After you have reviewed a set of documents, tag them with “reviewed” in addition to any other tags you might want, such as “interesting” or “follow up.” Then you can instantly see what you have not reviewed by using the _Show Untagged_ button.

If you are working together with other people to review documents, you can add a tag called “In review by XY” when you start reviewing a folder. When review is complete, add the “Reviewed by XY” tag, and remove the “In review” tag. If the documents being reviewed by different team members overlap, these tags will make it easier to avoid duplicate work.

Grouping Tags
Tags are sorted alphabetically. To group tags, start the tag name with the same letter or punctuation: “+ a”, “+ x”, “* b”, “* y”, “* z”

Color code tags with the same or similar colors, to indicate similar concepts.  Use long tag names, to make selection less error prone (no accidental hitting the + or – buttons).

To change tag colors or names, open the Organize Tags dialog box by clicking on the link at the bottom of the tags pane, then click on the tag name or color to change.



 

Create a visualization from your tags
See the Export this list as a spreadsheet link at the top of  the Organize Tags dialog box? That will produce a CSV which lists how many documents have each tag, like this:



You can load this data into another program to visualize it. This is how Mick Conroy of TemperoUK created this analysis of the social media conversation around drones, by importing the tag data into this visualization software.


Tag all documents that do not contain tag “abc”:
Tag all documents with a new tag “Not abc” (by selecting the top of the tree)
Select the “abc” tag
Remove the “Not abc” tag from the selected documents (click on the ‘-‘ on the “Not abc” tag)

Tag all documents that have tags “a” OR “b” OR “c”
Select tag “a”
Create a new tag “a or b or c”. All “a” documents should now have this tag.
Select tag “b”
Add the “a or b or c” tag (click on the ‘+’ on the “a or b or c” tag)
Select tag “c”
Add the “a or b or c” tag.
Tag all documents that have tags “a” AND “b” AND “c”
Using the first procedure above, creates tags for “not a”, “not b”, and “not c”
Using the second procedure above, create a “not a OR not b OR not c” tag.
Using the first procedure above, crete “Not (not a OR not b OR not c)”, calling it “a and b and c”
