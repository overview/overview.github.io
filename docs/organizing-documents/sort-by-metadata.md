# Sort by metadata

Now you can sort your document list by metadata fields.

By default, Overview has always sorted documents alphabetically by title:

![found 11 documents](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-from-2017-07-21-11-59-24.png)

Now you can sort in a different way. First, add a Field and set a value on each document:

![location field](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-from-2017-07-21-12-04-39.png)

Now, change “Sorted by title” to your new Field:

![found 11 documents sorted by location](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-from-2017-07-21-12-01-17.png)

You can click the arrow to reverse the sort order:

![found 11 documents sorted by location reverse order](/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screenshot-from-2017-07-21-12-01-52.png)

This should help you stay organized.
