# Keyboard shortcuts

It’s a little known fact that Overview has several keyboard shortcuts to make navigating through your documents even faster:

__j__, __k__ — view next and previous document in the list.

__arrow keys__ — navigate through tree. Selects parent, child, and sibling folders.

__u__ — go back to document list, when viewing a single document.

Both of these sets of keys are essential for rapid review. You can select a folder, press __j__ to read the first document (which automatically switches from the document list to the single document view) and then press __right arrow__ to go to the next folder in the tree.
