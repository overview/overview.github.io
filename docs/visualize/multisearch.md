# Multisearch - Save your favorite searches

Multisearch looks for many search terms in all documents at once.

You can add items one by one, or click __Edit entire list as text__ to paste in lots of search terms at once. After you’ve added a search you can edit the query by clicking the __Edit__ link to the right. In this example, the search named “environmental” actually searches for “environmental OR environment”. You can also do fuzzy searches by adding a ~ (tilde) to the end of the query, like “Obama~” which can be incredibly useful for searching through documents that have been poorly scanned and OCRd. Multisearch supports the same advanced query syntax as Overview’s regular search.
