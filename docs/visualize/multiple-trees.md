# Tree - Using multiple trees

Starting today Overview supports multiple trees for each document set. That is, you can tell Overview to re-import your documents — or a subset of them — with different options, without uploading them again. You can use this to:

* Focus on a subset of your documents, such as those with a particular tag or containing a specific word.

* Use ignored and important words to try sorting your documents in different ways.

You create a new tree using the “New Tree” link above the tree:
