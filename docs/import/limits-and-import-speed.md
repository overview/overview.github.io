# Limits and import speed

When using the public site (https://www.overviewdocs.com), the limits and import speeds are as follows:

* Import a maximum of 2,000,000 documents

* Max 655,360 Unicode characters per document

* Speed: Overview can ingest 100 Word documents per minute or 500 PDFs per minute, across all users. OCR is slower: 100 pages per minute. (These are rough estimates.)
These numbers assume four concurrent conversions. 

If you're using a custom install, you can choose how many concurrent conversions to allow. (Overview-local defaults to running only one conversion at a time.)
