# How to use Overview to analyze social media posts

Even when 10,000 people post about the same topic, they’re not saying 10,000 different things. People talking about an event will focus on different aspects of it, or have different reactions, but many people will be saying pretty much the same thing. People posting about a product might be talking about one or another of its features, the price, their experience using it, or how it compares to competitors. Citizens of a city might be concerned about many different things, but which things are the most important? Overview’s document sorting system groups similar posts so you can find these conversations quickly, and figure out how many people are saying what.

This post explains how to use Overview to quickly figure out what the different “conversations” are, how many people are involved in each, and how they overlap.
