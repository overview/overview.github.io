#Topic tree - Organize documents into folders

Before computers, all document-driven stories started with a big stack of paper. Often, the first task was to organize all that paper, by sorting individual documents into piles by type. This gives journalists a high-level idea of “what’s in there” and helps them decide what to read more closely — and just as importantly, what isn’t worth reading.

Today a computer can organize your documents for you. That stack of paper may now be a folder full of PDF files, but it still doesn’t come with any sort of built-in index or obvious categorization system. This is exactly the problem that Overview solves: It splits documents into piles based on their subjects, and then splits each pile into even more specific sub-piles, and so on. The result is a tree of folders.
